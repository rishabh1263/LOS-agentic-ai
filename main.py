"""
LOS Agentic AI service entrypoint.

Serves the Document Agent (PAN / Driving Licence / Voter ID / Passport), the
Financial Agent (bank statements, ITR, salary slips) and the Fraud & Risk
Agent.

Two dispatch paths exist, deliberately:

    /api/v1/agents/execute and /api/v1/extract-document
        Go through the LangGraph orchestrator, so agent configuration from
        agents.yaml, retry classification, circuit breaking, bulkheads and
        decision audit apply.

    /api/v1/document-agent
        The unified Document Agent API. Calls the document workflow directly
        -- extraction here is deterministic (OCR plus regex and spatial
        reasoning, no model call), so there is no model failure to retry or
        circuit-break around. It runs its own executors to keep the event
        loop free. An earlier version of this docstring claimed everything
        went through the orchestrator; it never did.

Run:
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8010

# FastAPI 0.138 emits OpenAPI 3.1, where a binary upload is described as
#
#     {"type": "string", "contentMediaType": "application/octet-stream"}
#
# Swagger UI looks for `format: binary` to decide it should draw a file
# picker. Not finding one, it falls back to treating the field as a plain
# string array and renders "Add string item" -- so the multi-document upload
# this endpoint has always accepted could not be exercised from the docs page.
#
# The endpoint declaration is already correct (list[UploadFile] = File(...));
# only the emitted schema needed fixing. `format: binary` is ADDED rather than
# substituted, so 3.1 consumers keep the annotation they expect and Swagger UI
# gets the one it needs -- and the app stays on OpenAPI 3.1 instead of being
# downgraded wholesale for the sake of one widget.
