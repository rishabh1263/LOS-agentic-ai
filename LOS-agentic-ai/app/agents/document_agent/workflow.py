"""
Unified Document Agent workflow.

Public workflow:

    upload
        -> document preparation
        -> OCR / classification
        -> identity OR financial routing
        -> extraction
        -> structural verification
        -> unified result

Design principles
-----------------
1. The API exposes one stable document-processing contract.
2. Identity-document extraction reuses the same OCR tokens for verification.
3. Financial processing remains delegated to the existing Financial Agent.
4. Existing specialised extractors are not reimplemented here.
5. KYC/Name Match is intentionally left as a future workflow stage.
6. Agent-specific implementation details never become part of the public
   response contract.

Execution model
---------------
Everything below the async entry point is synchronous and runs on the document
executor, never on the event loop. OCR itself is handed to the serialised OCR
worker. Recognition, PDF rasterisation and pypdf parsing all block for
seconds at a time; running them inline made a single upload stall every other
request on the process, readiness probes included.

Multi-page PDFs
---------------
Each page is recognised and extracted on its own and the per-page results are
combined with pipeline.merge_results(). Token coordinates are page-local, so
concatenating pages into one token list put page three's text at page one's
coordinates -- labels matched values from the wrong side of the document, and
the signature-ink check measured one page's caption against another page's
pixels.
