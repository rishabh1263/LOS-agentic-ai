"""
A bank statement's verification evidence, bank-independent.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. Turning what the parser found into named checks the shared
scoring layer can weigh, and — the part that was missing — into REASON CODES.

The financial verification path published `{"status": ..., "checks": {...}}`
and no reason codes at all, so every bank statement that did not pass came
back as:

    verification: REVIEW
    reason_codes: []

A field officer was told a document needed review and nothing about what to
do with it. The verdict was usually right; it was simply unexplained.

BASIC DOCUMENT VERIFICATION ONLY. Every check here asks whether the document
is a readable, structurally coherent, internally consistent bank statement.
None of them looks at what the money means. There is no income estimate, no
affordability, no spending pattern and no risk — those belong to the credit
stage, and a FOS response that carried them would be that stage's answer
given by a desk with no authority to give it.
