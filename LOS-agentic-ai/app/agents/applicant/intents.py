"""
What the FOS asked, and which tools answer it.

RULES BEFORE MODEL. Intent is decided by matching phrases, not by asking a
language model to classify. A FOS asking "is PAN verified?" should not wait a
second and a half for a model to decide that the question is about a document,
and a classifier that occasionally routes "what's pending" to the credit agent
is worse than no classifier.

The patterns are ordered: the most specific intent that matches wins. Anything
that matches nothing becomes UNKNOWN, which is answered with a list of what
this agent can actually do rather than a guess.

Out-of-scope intents are matched FIRST and deliberately. A question about a
credit score must be routed on before anything tries to answer it from FOS
data.
