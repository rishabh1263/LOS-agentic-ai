"""
KYC contract.

The KYC Agent does not read documents. It consumes what the Document Agent and
the Financial Agent have ALREADY extracted and normalised, and answers one
question: do these documents describe the same person, consistently?

Keeping it downstream of extraction is deliberate. OCR is expensive and
non-deterministic; cross-document consistency is neither, and it should not be
re-litigated every time someone wants a second opinion on the same file.
