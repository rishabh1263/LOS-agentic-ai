"""
KYC Agent.

Answers one question: do these documents describe the same person,
consistently? It runs entirely on values the Document Agent and Financial
Agent have already extracted -- it never touches an image, and it never
re-runs OCR.

It does NOT establish that any document is genuine. That is the Verification
Agent's question, and neither agent detects a competent forgery.

Decisioning
-----------
Each check returns PASS, REVIEW, FAIL or SKIPPED. The overall verdict is the
worst of them, with one qualification: a check marked non-blocking in policy
can raise the result to REVIEW but cannot by itself FAIL an applicant. Address
and income are non-blocking by default because documents legitimately disagree
on both -- people move, and bank credits are not salary. The finding is never
suppressed; it is reported with its own FAIL status and reason codes, and only
its effect on the overall verdict is capped.
