# LOS Agentic AI — API Integration Guide

For the team integrating against this service. Everything below is the
contract as implemented and verified over real HTTP; nothing here is
aspirational.

---

## 1. Purpose

One call takes an applicant's documents end to end: each is classified,
verified and — only behind a verification PASS — extracted. The normalised
results are cross-checked against each other by KYC, a deterministic decision
is computed, and one response comes back.

**Every decision is deterministic.** A language model, when switched on,
writes the one-sentence `summary` and nothing else. It cannot change
verification, extraction, KYC, `cross_document`, `decision` or `next_action`.

You do **not** need to know about the internal agents, OCR engines, MCP, the
orchestrator, or the model. You consume one endpoint and one JSON contract.

---

## 2. Base URL

```
{BASE_URL}          e.g. http://localhost:8010   (local)
                         https://los.internal.example   (deployed)
```

All paths below are relative to `{BASE_URL}`.

---

## 3. Authentication

Every business endpoint requires a Bearer JWT. Health and metrics do not.

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

- Algorithm **RS256**, verified against a JWKS endpoint.
- `iss`, `aud`, `exp`, `nbf` and `iat` are all validated. Signature
  validation is never skipped.
- Keys are fetched from `JWT_JWKS_URL` and cached for
  `JWT_JWKS_CACHE_SECONDS`.
- A small clock skew is tolerated (`JWT_LEEWAY_SECONDS`, default 30s).

Obtain tokens from your identity provider. No token is embedded in this
repository or this document.

| Failure | Response |
|---|---|
| No `Authorization` header | `401` `{"detail": "Missing Bearer token."}` |
| Expired / not yet valid | `401` `{"detail": "JWT token expired."}` |
| Wrong issuer or audience | `401` `{"detail": "JWT issuer is invalid."}` |
| Signature or `kid` unresolvable | `401` `{"detail": "Unable to resolve JWT signing key."}` |

---

## 4. Endpoint

```
POST {BASE_URL}/api/v1/los/process
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

This is the **only** endpoint an integration needs. Other routes exist for
backward compatibility and internal use; do not build against them.

### Request fields

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `files` | file[] | yes | One or more documents in a single request. Repeat the field once per file. Max **10** per request, max **25 MB** each. |
| `operation` | string | no | `PROCESS` (default), `EXTRACT`, `VERIFY`. |
| `applicant_id` | string | no | Stable identifier for the **person**. |
| `case_id` | string | no | Identifier for **one application**. Omit to start a new case; the generated id is returned. |
| `expected_types` | string | no | Comma-separated, **positionally matched** to `files`. |

### `operation`

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **`PROCESS`** | The production verb. Runs the whole application: classify → verify → extract behind the gate → specialist capabilities → KYC → cross-document → decision → summary. |
| `EXTRACT` | The Document Agent's own mode. Behaves as `PROCESS`; kept for existing callers. |
| `VERIFY` | Verdict only — **never** releases extracted fields. |

Case and surrounding whitespace are tolerated. Anything else is `422`.

### `expected_types` is positional

```
files[0] = PAN.pdf          expected_types[0] = PAN
files[1] = DL.pdf           expected_types[1] = DRIVING_LICENCE
```

```
expected_types=PAN,DRIVING_LICENCE
```

- Use `AUTO` (or omit the field entirely) to let classification decide. No
  type check is performed for `AUTO`.
- A short list is allowed: files beyond the last entry are treated as `AUTO`.
- Asserting a type is a **commitment**. See §6.

Supported types: `PAN`, `DRIVING_LICENCE`, `VOTER_ID`, `PASSPORT`,
`BANK_STATEMENT`, `ITR`, `SALARY_SLIP`, `SALE_DEED`, `BUSINESS_PROOF_1`,
`BUSINESS_PROOF_2`, `SIGNATURE`.

---

## 5. The verification gate

```
classification  ->  verification  ->  extraction
                                      (only when verification == PASS)
```

| `verification` | `extraction` |
|---|---|
| `PASS` | released (unless extraction is disabled by configuration) |
| `FAIL` | `null` |
| `REVIEW` | `null` |
| `SKIPPED` | `null` |

**`SKIPPED` is never treated as `PASS`.** A check that did not run has
established nothing. If verification is switched off service-wide, every
document reports `SKIPPED`, no fields are released, and the application
cannot reach `PASS` — it returns `REVIEW` with a `NO_VERIFIED_DOCUMENTS`
entry in `errors`.

---

## 6. Strict document-type validation

If you assert a type and a different one arrives, the document fails
immediately — **before** any type-specific extractor or specialist runs.

```
expected_types = PAN          uploaded = a driving licence
```

```json
{
  "source_id": "pan.jpg",
  "expected_type": "PAN",
  "type": "DRIVING_LICENCE",
  "status": "REJECTED",
  "verification": "FAIL",
  "reason_codes": ["DOCUMENT_TYPE_MISMATCH"],
  "extraction": null
}
```

Symmetric: asserting `DRIVING_LICENCE` and uploading a PAN behaves the same
way.

**At application level this is a wrong upload, not a rejected applicant:**

```
status       PARTIAL | REVIEW
decision     REVIEW            (never REJECT for this alone)
next_action  REQUEST_CORRECT_DOCUMENT
```

The applicant has the document and sent the wrong file. That is why
`REQUEST_CORRECT_DOCUMENT` is distinct from `REQUEST_VALID_DOCUMENT`, which
means the right kind of document could not be read.

---

## 7. Response contract

`200 OK`, `application/json`. Top-level fields, always present:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `request_id` | string | Correlation id for this call. Quote it in support requests. |
| `applicant_id` | string \| null | Echoed. |
| `case_id` | string | Echoed, or generated if you omitted it. |
| `status` | enum | Application roll-up. |
| `documents` | array | **Same order as uploaded.** |
| `kyc` | object | `{status, reason_codes}` |
| `cross_document` | object | `{status, checks[]}` |
| `decision` | enum | Deterministic outcome. Not a credit decision. |
| `next_action` | enum | What should happen next. |
| `summary` | string | One sentence. |
| `summary_source` | enum | `deterministic` or `llm`. |
| `processing_ms` | number | Server-side duration. |
| `errors` | array | `{code, message, source_id?}`. Empty when none. |

### Enums

**`status`** (application)

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `SUCCESS` | Every document succeeded and KYC passed. |
| `PARTIAL` | Some documents need attention. |
| `REVIEW` | Needs a human; also used when nothing was verified. |
| `REJECTED` | A blocking condition was met. |
| `FAILED` | A document could not be processed at all. |

**`documents[].status`** — `SUCCESS`, `REVIEW`, `SKIPPED`, `REJECTED`, `FAILED`

**`documents[].verification`** — `PASS`, `REVIEW`, `FAIL`, `SKIPPED`

**`decision`** — `PASS`, `REVIEW`, `REJECT`

> `decision` restates the deterministic roll-up. It is **not** an
> underwriting outcome and weighs no credit policy. `PASS` additionally
> requires that something was actually verified.

**`next_action`**

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `CONTINUE` | Proceed. |
| `MANUAL_REVIEW` | A human should look at it. |
| `REQUEST_CORRECT_DOCUMENT` | Wrong document type uploaded. |
| `REQUEST_VALID_DOCUMENT` | Right kind of document, could not be read. |

**`kyc.status` / `cross_document.status`** — `PASS`, `REVIEW`, `FAIL`, `SKIPPED`

> `SKIPPED` means nothing was comparable — not that everything agreed.

### `documents[]`

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `source_id` | The filename you uploaded. Your join key. |
| `type` | Type this service identified, or `UNKNOWN`. |
| `expected_type` | What you asserted. Absent for `AUTO`. |
| `status` | Per-document roll-up. |
| `verification` | The verdict. |
| `extraction` | Fields, or absent/`null`. Keys depend on the type. |
| `reason_codes` | Present only when there is something to say. |
| `specialist` | Present only for specialist-handled evidence. |
| `evidence_refs` | `{source_id, locator}`. Locators are anchored on your `source_id` — never a server path. |
| `errors` | Per-document problems. |

### Common reason codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `DOCUMENT_TYPE_MISMATCH` | Detected type ≠ asserted type. |
| `VERIFICATION_DISABLED` | Verification switched off by configuration. |
| `CLASSIFICATION_DISABLED` | Classification switched off. |
| `EXTRACTION_DISABLED` | Passed verification, but extraction is off. |
| `CAPABILITY_DISABLED` | That specialist is switched off. |
| `NO_VERIFIED_DOCUMENTS` | Application-level: nothing cleared verification. |
| `NAME_MISMATCH` / `DOB_MISMATCH` / `PAN_MISMATCH` | Documents disagree. |
| `*_SINGLE_SOURCE` / `*_MISSING` | Nothing to compare against. |
| `INSUFFICIENT_SOURCES` | Fewer than two comparable documents. |

---

## 8. KYC and cross-document consistency

KYC runs **after** every document finishes, over normalised values only. It
establishes that the documents describe the same person consistently. It does
**not** establish that any document is genuine.

Checks: `NAME`, `DOB`, `ADDRESS`, `PAN`, `INCOME`.

**Policy: ordinary disagreement is non-blocking.** Two documents naming
different people is a reason to involve a human, not a finding of fraud —
married names, corrected dates, expanded initials and transliterations all
look the same to this service. So:

```
NAME / DOB / PAN mismatch
  -> the CHECK reports FAIL, with the values
  -> kyc.status          REVIEW
  -> cross_document      REVIEW
  -> decision            REVIEW
  -> next_action         MANUAL_REVIEW
```

A check can be made blocking in `app/config/kyc_policies.yaml`
(`blocking: true`), which restores `FAIL` → `decision: REJECT`. That is a
business policy decision, not a code change.

**Disagreements are source-attributed** — you get which documents and what
each said:

```json
{
  "check": "NAME",
  "status": "FAIL",
  "reason_codes": ["NAME_MISMATCH"],
  "sources": ["pan.jpg", "dl.jpg", "voter4.jpg"],
  "details": {
    "pan.jpg": "RISHABH AJIT SINGH",
    "dl.jpg": "RISHABH AJIT SINGH",
    "voter4.jpg": "KUNTI"
  }
}
```

Two documents that agree are **not** reported as mismatching each other. A
document that simply lacks the field does not cause a mismatch — the check
reports `SKIPPED` with a `*_MISSING` / `*_SINGLE_SOURCE` reason. Values are
never invented.

---

## 9. Bank statements

Extraction is released only after verification `PASS`, which for a statement
means **the transaction rows reconcile against the balance the statement
itself prints**.

```json
"extraction": {
  "account_number_masked": "XXXXXXXXXX5119",
  "period_start": "2026-01-22",
  "period_end": "2026-07-21",
  "signals": {
    "average_monthly_credit": "133877.63",
    "closing_balance": "229.70",
    "total_credits": "789878.00",
    "total_debits": "794473.00",
    "months_covered": 5.9,
    "declared_annual_income": null,
    "monthly_net_salary": null,
    "monthly_gross_salary": null
  },
  "evidence": {
    "reconciled": true,
    "opening_balance_source": "printed",
    "transaction_count": 524,
    "credit_count": 325,
    "debit_count": 199,
    "minimum_balance": "229.70",
    "maximum_balance": "214981.70",
    "average_transaction_balance": "34453.15",
    "largest_credit": "200000.00",
    "largest_debit": "90000.00",
    "monthly_credit_count": 7,
    "credit_volatility": 0.6612
  }
}
```

`evidence` is **deterministic evidence for a risk engine, not a credit
decision.** Nothing in it concludes anything about affordability.

Read these two fields carefully:

- **`reconciled`** — the rows explain the printed closing balance exactly.
- **`opening_balance_source`** — `"printed"` means the opening balance was
  read off the statement, so every row including the first was checked
  against an independent figure. `"derived"` means it was inferred from row
  one, which leaves row one's own side unverified: a wrong side there and a
  wrong opening cancel out and the chain still balances. Most Indian
  statements do not print an opening balance, so `"derived"` is common.
  Weight the signals accordingly.

Absent evidence is **absent, not zero** — no `salary_credit_count` means the
statement does not use the word, not that there were no salary credits. A
statement whose rows did **not** reconcile produces **no** `evidence` at all.

Raw transaction rows are never returned in this response.

---

## 10. HTTP status codes

As implemented:

| Code | When | Body |
|---|---|---|
| `200` | Processing completed. **Includes REVIEW and REJECT** — those are business outcomes, not transport errors. | Full contract |
| `400` | `NO_DOCUMENTS`, `EMPTY_FILE`, `INVALID_REQUEST` | `{"detail": {"request_id", "error", "message"}}` |
| `401` | Missing/invalid/expired token | `{"detail": "<reason>"}` |
| `413` | `TOO_MANY_DOCUMENTS` (>10), `FILE_TOO_LARGE` (>25 MB) | `{"detail": {...}}` |
| `422` | Invalid `operation`; FastAPI request validation (e.g. no `files` part) | `{"detail": ...}` |
| `500` | `LOS_PROCESSING_FAILED` | `{"detail": {"request_id", "error", "message"}}` |

**Do not treat `decision: REVIEW` or `REJECT` as an HTTP failure.** They are
`200`.

A `500` never contains a traceback, an internal path or a provider error —
only a safe message and the `request_id` to quote.

---

## 11. What is never in the response

OCR tokens · bounding boxes · candidate lists · confidence matrices · model
prompts · MCP payloads · stack traces · filesystem or temporary upload paths
· internal stage timings · internal agent state · thread ids · provider
internals · raw transaction rows.

`evidence_refs[].locator` is always anchored on your own `source_id`
(`sig.png#region=0,136,640,166`, `deed.pdf#page=1`) and never a server path.

Only `processing_ms` is published; the per-stage breakdown stays internal.

---

### Wrong document type

}
```

### KYC REVIEW with source attribution

```json
{
  "status": "PARTIAL",
  "documents": [
    { "source_id": "pan.jpg", "type": "PAN", "status": "SUCCESS",
      "verification": "PASS", "extraction": { "name": "RISHABH AJIT SINGH" } },

      "verification": "PASS", "extraction": { "name": "RISHABH AJIT SINGH" } },
    { "source_id": "voter4.jpg", "type": "VOTER_ID", "status": "SUCCESS",
      "verification": "PASS", "extraction": { "name": "KUNTI" } }
  ],
  "kyc": { "status": "REVIEW", "reason_codes": ["NAME_MISMATCH"] },
  "cross_document": {
    "status": "REVIEW",
    "checks": [
      { "check": "NAME", "status": "FAIL", "reason_codes": ["NAME_MISMATCH"],
        "sources": ["pan.jpg", "dl.jpg", "voter4.jpg"],
        "details": { "pan.jpg": "RISHABH AJIT SINGH",
                     "dl.jpg": "RISHABH AJIT SINGH",
                     "voter4.jpg": "KUNTI" } },

  "summary_source": "deterministic",
  "processing_ms": 5210.4,
  "errors": []
}
```

Note `DOB` is `PASS`: the two documents that carry a date of birth agree, and
the one that does not carry it is not counted as a disagreement.

### Error

```json
{
  "detail": {
    "request_id": "los_...",
    "error": "TOO_MANY_DOCUMENTS",
    "message": "At most 10 documents per application."
  }
}
```

## 13. Calling it

**TypeScript**

```ts
const form = new FormData();
form.append("files", panFile);
form.append("files", dlFile);
form.append("operation", "PROCESS");
form.append("applicant_id", "APP-12345");
form.append("case_id", "CASE-12345");
form.append("expected_types", "PAN,DRIVING_LICENCE");

const res = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/api/v1/los/process`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },   // no Content-Type: the
  body: form,                                      // browser sets the boundary
});
const result = await res.json();
```

**Python**

```python
import requests

files = [
    ("files", ("PAN.pdf", open("PAN.pdf", "rb"), "application/pdf")),
    ("files", ("DL.pdf", open("DL.pdf", "rb"), "application/pdf")),
]
data = {
    "operation": "PROCESS",
    "applicant_id": "APP-12345",
    "case_id": "CASE-12345",
    "expected_types": "PAN,DRIVING_LICENCE",
}
r = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/api/v1/los/process",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"},
    files=files, data=data, timeout=120,
)
result = r.json()
```

**Java (JDK 11+)** — use any multipart builder (OkHttp, Apache HttpClient):

```java
RequestBody body = new MultipartBody.Builder()
    .setType(MultipartBody.FORM)
    .addFormDataPart("files", "PAN.pdf",
        RequestBody.create(panBytes, MediaType.parse("application/pdf")))
    .addFormDataPart("files", "DL.pdf",
        RequestBody.create(dlBytes, MediaType.parse("application/pdf")))
    .addFormDataPart("operation", "PROCESS")
    .addFormDataPart("applicant_id", "APP-12345")
    .addFormDataPart("case_id", "CASE-12345")
    .addFormDataPart("expected_types", "PAN,DRIVING_LICENCE")
    .build();
```

**.NET**

```csharp
using var form = new MultipartFormDataContent();
form.Add(new ByteArrayContent(panBytes), "files", "PAN.pdf");
form.Add(new ByteArrayContent(dlBytes),  "files", "DL.pdf");
form.Add(new StringContent("PROCESS"), "operation");
form.Add(new StringContent("APP-12345"), "applicant_id");
form.Add(new StringContent("CASE-12345"), "case_id");
form.Add(new StringContent("PAN,DRIVING_LICENCE"), "expected_types");

client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization =
    new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", token);
var res = await client.PostAsync($"{BASE_URL}/api/v1/los/process", form);
```

Set a client timeout of at least **120 s**: OCR on several scanned documents
is CPU-bound.

## 14. Swagger

```
{BASE_URL}/docs           Swagger UI
{BASE_URL}/redoc          ReDoc
{BASE_URL}/openapi.json   Raw OpenAPI 3.1
```

`files` renders as a real multi-file picker. Click **Authorize**, paste the
raw token (no `Bearer ` prefix — Swagger adds it), then **Try it out**.

---

## 15. Applicant and case

- `applicant_id` identifies a **person**, reused across applications.
- `case_id` identifies **one application**. One applicant may hold several,
  and they stay separate.
- Supply `case_id` to keep results under the same id; omit it and one is
  generated and returned.

This call is **stateless**. Everything in the response is scoped to the case
named in it. There is no server-side case store — persistence is the
integrator's responsibility.

---

## 16. LLM summary (implementation detail)

Only `summary` and `summary_source` are affected.

- Exactly **one** application-level generation call per request. Never one
  per document.
- Runs **last**, after every decision is final. It is shown statuses and
  counts — never extracted values such as a PAN or a date of birth.
- Budget **1.5 s**, output capped at 64 tokens. No retries.
- If the provider is unreachable, slow, or its sentence fails validation, the
  deterministic summary is returned and `summary_source` is `deterministic`.
  The request still returns `200` and **no other field changes**.

### `summary_source` is observed, not guaranteed

Measured on the reference host — Intel Core 7 240H, 10 cores, **CPU-only, no
GPU**, `qwen2.5:3b`, 1.5 s budget, 64-token cap — by calling the running HTTP
API with real multipart uploads, 8 requests per row:

| Documents | `summary_source: "llm"` |
|---|---|
| 1 | **7 of 8** |
| 2 | **2 of 8** |
| 4 | **7 of 8** |

Before the tuning described in `docs/API_HANDOVER.md` §5, the same benchmark
returned `deterministic` on **every** request.

The two-document row is the weak one, and the reason is visible in the
internal timings: that bundle carries two KYC mismatch codes, so the sentence
is longer, and generation lands around 1.5 s — right on the boundary.

**Generation cost alone**, model resident, 12 runs per shape: median
**1076–1496 ms** depending on how much there is to say.

**Cold start is always a fallback.** With the model evicted, the first call
costs ~8 s (3.7 s to load the model, 2.9 s to read the prompt). This is why
the service warms the model at startup and asks Ollama to keep it resident —
see `LOS_LLM_KEEP_ALIVE`.

**This is not a fault.** The budget is a fast-fail bound on an optional
final-stage nicety. Overrunning it costs the sentence and nothing else: every
decision in the response was final before the model was consulted.

To see `llm` more often: give Ollama a GPU or a host with spare CPU, raise
`LOS_LLM_SUMMARY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, lower `LOS_LLM_SUMMARY_MAX_TOKENS`, or set
`LLM_SLOW_COOLDOWN_SECONDS=0`.

**Do not write client logic that depends on `summary_source` being `llm`.**
Read the field, show the sentence, and treat either value as normal.
`deterministic` is not an error.

If `summary_source` is `deterministic`, nothing is wrong with the
application — only the sentence was written without a model.

## 17. Deployment

### Run

```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8010
```

Behind a reverse proxy terminating TLS. Allow multipart bodies of at least
**256 MB** (10 files × 25 MB) and a proxy read timeout of **≥120 s**.

Workers: the service uses internal thread pools for OCR and document work and
holds one OCR model **per OCR worker**. Start with **one uvicorn worker per
2–4 cores** and size by memory, not by core count.

### Endpoints for infrastructure

| Path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/health` | none | Liveness. |
| `/ready` | none | Readiness. |
| `/metrics` | none | Metrics. |

### Environment variables

**Authentication (required)**

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `JWT_JWKS_URL` | JWKS endpoint. Service refuses to start without it. |
| `JWT_ISSUER` | Expected `iss`. |
| `JWT_AUDIENCE` | Expected `aud`. |
| `JWT_ALGORITHM` | `RS256`. |
| `JWT_LEEWAY_SECONDS` | Default `30`. |
| `JWT_JWKS_CACHE_SECONDS` | Default `300`. |

**LLM summary (optional)**

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `OLLAMA_HOST` | Default `http://127.0.0.1:11434`. |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | `qwen2.5:3b`. Use a small **non-reasoning** model — a reasoning model thinks before answering and cannot meet the budget. |
| `LOS_LLM_SUMMARY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Default `1.5`. |
| `LOS_LLM_SUMMARY_MAX_TOKENS` | Default `64`, chosen by measurement. |
| `LOS_LLM_KEEP_ALIVE` | Default `30m`. How long Ollama holds the model resident. Ollama's own default of 5 min makes an idle deployment pay a ~3.7 s reload, which always overruns the budget. |
| `LLM_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Default `0.5`. |
| `LLM_UNAVAILABLE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` | Default `60`. Provider **not listening**. |
| `LLM_SLOW_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` | Default `2`. Provider **answered late**. Deliberately much shorter — see `docs/API_HANDOVER.md` §5. |

The LLM is **not** a hard dependency. With no provider at all the service
runs normally and every summary is deterministic.

**OCR and processing**

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `DOCUMENT_OCR_ENGINE` | `rapidocr`. |
| `DOCUMENT_OCR_WORKERS` | Default 2, capped at CPU count. **One model per worker** — raising it costs memory. Do **not** set it to 1: recognition then serialises and four documents took 29.3 s against 3.5 s with two workers. |
| `DOCUMENT_OCR_THREADS` | ONNX intra-op threads **per engine**. Default `(logical CPUs / 2) / workers` — 4 on a 16-CPU host. Previously unbounded, which asked for `workers × cores` threads and lost the difference to contention. `0` restores the old behaviour. |
| `DOCUMENT_OCR_WARMUP` | Default `true`. Loads every worker's model at startup; leave on or the first request pays it. |
| `AGENT_UPLOAD_ROOT` | Scratch directory for staged uploads. |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` | Applies to `/api/v1/extract-document` **only**. Default 25 MB. |

**The limit on `POST /api/v1/los/process` is not configurable.** It is the
constant `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` in `app/agents/document_agent/workflow.py`, fixed
at **25 MB per file**, with at most **10 files** per application. Setting the
environment variable does not change it. Over the per-file limit returns `413`
`FILE_TOO_LARGE`; over ten files returns `413` `TOO_MANY_DOCUMENTS`.

**Feature flags** — `app/config/documents.yaml`, section `los:`, each
overridable as `LOS_<NAME>`:

`classification_enabled`, `verification_enabled`, `extraction_enabled`,
`financial_enabled`, `kyc_enabled`, `conflict_detection_enabled`,
`signature_enabled`, `business_evidence_enabled`, `sale_deed_enabled`,
`collateral_customer_enabled`, `collateral_property_enabled`,
`llm_summary_enabled`.

**Off means off** — the capability does not run and the response says so with
an explicit `SKIPPED` / disabled reason. It never silently behaves as enabled.

**KYC policy** — `app/config/kyc_policies.yaml`: thresholds and per-check
`blocking` flags. Changing whether a mismatch can reject an applicant is a
config change, reviewable in version control.

### Operational notes

- **Temporary files.** Uploads are staged under `AGENT_UPLOAD_ROOT` and
  unlinked after processing. Mount it writable; size it for peak concurrency
  × 250 MB.
- **Startup.** Risk policy is validated and OCR models are loaded before the
  service reports ready. Expect a few seconds; do not route traffic until
  `/ready` passes.
- **Logging.** Structured to stdout, level via `LOG_LEVEL`. Logs carry
  `request_id` — the same one in the response body.
- **Signed policy.** If the risk policy is not signed off, the service logs a
  warning at startup and thresholds marked `[PLACEHOLDER]` are not
  authoritative. Sign off before production use.

## 18. Stability

- Field names, enum values and reason codes are stable; treat them as the
  contract.
- Optional keys (`extraction`, `reason_codes`, `specialist`,
  `evidence_refs`, `expected_type`) are **absent** rather than `null` when
  they do not apply — except `extraction`, which is explicitly `null` when
  the gate withheld it. Handle both.
- Lists are always present and may be empty; they are never `null`.
- Monetary values are JSON **strings** to preserve precision. Parse as
  decimal, not float.
- Dates are ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `documents` is always in the order you uploaded — join on `source_id`.
