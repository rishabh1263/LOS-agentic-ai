What the FOS stage owns, and what it must not reach for.

THE DISTINCTION THIS SUITE DEFENDS:

    DOCUMENT VERIFICATION   is this upload usable as the type it claims?
    KYC                     do these documents describe the same person?

They are different questions asked at different stages, and the FOS copilot
owns only the first. A field officer uploading a PAN and a licence was being
handed a cross-document comparison of name, date of birth and father's name --
a KYC result, produced by an upload endpoint, at a stage with no authority to
act on it. Two documents passing verification does not mean anything about
whether they belong to one person, and FOS is not the desk that decides.

KYC ITSELF IS UNTOUCHED. The agent, its matching, its thresholds and its
tests are all unchanged. What changed is who calls it: the FOS upload no
longer does, and /api/v1/los/process still does.
