"""
Turn a finished Document Agent response into a KYC source document.

This is the seam that keeps KYC free of extraction logic. Everything here is a
field lookup on an already-normalised result -- no OCR, no parsing, no
re-reading of anything. If a value is absent from the extraction it stays
absent: KYC must see the same gaps the extractor reported, because a gap it
cannot see is a gap it will silently treat as agreement.
