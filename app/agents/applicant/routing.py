"""
What kind of question this is, and therefore where the answer comes from.

FOUR CATEGORIES, AND THEY DECIDE THE WHOLE REQUEST:

    CASE_ONLY       the store answers it. No retrieval, no model needed.
    KNOWLEDGE_ONLY  the FOS handbook answers it. No case data is read.
    MIXED           both, combined. Case facts first, policy second.
    DOWNSTREAM      neither. FOS does not own it, so it is routed.

The category is what makes the latency targets reachable: a CASE_ONLY
question must not pay for retrieval it does not use, and a KNOWLEDGE_ONLY
question must not read records it has no business reading.

RESPONSE SOURCE IS NOT THE SAME QUESTION. The category says what was
consulted; `response_source` says what the answer was actually built from.
They usually agree, and where they do not the source is the honest one: a
MIXED question whose retrieval came back unconfident produces a STRUCTURED
answer, because only the store contributed.
