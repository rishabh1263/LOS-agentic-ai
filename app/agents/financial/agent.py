"""
Financial Agent.

Owns financial-document processing: routing to the right extractor,
normalising the result, and surfacing the figures underwriting needs.

It does NOT reimplement extraction. The bank statement parser, the ITR
extractor and the salary slip extractor stay exactly where they are and keep
their own APIs; this agent classifies, delegates and normalises. Replacing a
working parser with a generic one would lose the balance reconciliation and
grid reconstruction that took real documents to get right.
